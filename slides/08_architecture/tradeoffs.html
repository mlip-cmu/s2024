Aids in **communication** with stakeholders: Shows them “how” at a level they can understand, raising questions about whether it meets their needs

Defines **constraints** on implementation: Design decisions form “load-bearing walls” of application

Dictates **organizational structure**: Teams work on different components

Inhibits or enables **quality attributes**: Similar to design patterns

Supports **predicting** cost, quality, and schedule: Typically by predicting information for each component

Aids in software **evolution**: Reason about cost, design, and effect of changes

Designers and architects accumulate tacit and codified knowledge based on their own experience and best practices.

In designing a new system, it is best to start with experience and a design vocabulary, focusing directly on the specific qualities relevant to the tradeoffs.

At the highest level of organizing components, there are common structures shared by many systems, also known as _architectural styles_.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Monolithic system

![client-server](client-server-model.svg)<!-- .element: style="width:700px" -->

<div class="small">

* A server provides functionality to multiple clients, typically over a network connection.

</div>

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Multi-tier architecture

![typical 3-tier architecture](3tier.svg)<!-- .element: style="width:800px" -->

Higher tiers send requests to lower tiers, but not vice versa. 

Common for business and web applications.

<aside class="notes"><p>can be conceptually extended with components related to machine learning (as we will show in chapter Deploying a Model).</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## SOA and microservices

![audiobook app composed of microservices](microservice.svg)<!-- .element: style="width:600px" -->

Multiple self-contained services/processes that communicate via RPC.  

<aside class="notes"><p>allows independent deployment, versioning, and scaling of services and flexible routing of requests at the network level. Many modern, scalable web-based systems use this design, as we will discuss in chapter Scaling the System.  Also independent development.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Event-based architecture

![Delivery robot](deliveryrobot.jpg)
<!-- .element: class="plain stretch" -->

Individual system components listen to messages broadcasted by other components, typically through some message bus.

<aside class="notes"><p>Since the component publishing a message does not need to know who consumes it, this architecture strongly decouples components in a system and makes it easy to add new components. We will see this architecture style when discussing stream processing systems in chapter Scaling the System.</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Data-flow architectures


![Delivery robot](pipeline.svg)
<div class="small">

_Dataflow program composed of shell commands._

</div>

The system is organized around data, often in a sequential pipeline. 

<aside class="notes"><p>This design allows flexible changes of components and flexible composition of pipelines from different subsets of components. Unix shell commands can be composed through pipes to perform more complex tasks and machine-learning pipelines often follow this design of multiple transformations to a dataset arranged in a sequence or directed acyclic graph. Machine-learning pipelines tend to follow this data-flow style, as do batch processing systems for very large datasets.</p>

<!-- colstart -->
![Design Patterns](pattern-language.jpeg)<!-- .element: style="width:350px" class="stretch" -->

<!-- col -->

Design patterns name and describe common solutions to known design problems, and known advantages and pitfalls. 

Historically popular in OO; now applied broadly across system design, both architecturally and at a lower level (i.e., interactions among subsystems). 

<!-- colend --></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Observer or publish-subscribe

![Observer pattern](observer.png)<!-- .element: style="width:800px" -->

<div class="smallish">
Intent: Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
</div>

<aside class="notes"><p>Motivation: [This would include an illustrative example of a user interface that needs to update multiple visual representations of data whenever input data changes, such as multiple diagrams in a spreadsheet.] 
Solution: [This would include a description of the technical structure with an observer interface implemented by observers and an observable object managing a list of observers and calling them on state changes.]
Benefits, costs, tradeoffs: Decoupling of the observed object and observers; support of broadcast communication. Implementation overhead; observed objects unaware of consequences and costs of broadcast objects. [Typically this would be explained in more detail with examples.]</p>
</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Architectural pattern: Heartbeat tactic


![Heartbeat tactic](heartbeat.png)<!-- .element: style="width:800px" -->

Intent: Detect when a component is unavailable to trigger mitigations or repair

<aside class="notes"><p>Motivation: Detect with low latency when a component or server becomes unavailable to automatically restart it or redirect traffic.
Solution: The observed component sends heartbeat messages to another component monitoring the system in regular predictable intervals. When the monitoring component does not receive the message it assumes the observed component is unavailable and initiates corrective actions.
Options: The heartbeat message can carry data to be processed. Standard data messages can stand in for heartbeat messages so that extra messages are only sent when no regular data messages are sent for a period.
Benefits, costs, tradeoffs: Component operation can be observed. Only unidirectional messaging is needed. The observed component defines heartbeat frequency and thus detection latency and network overhead. Higher detection latency can be achieved at the cost of higher network traffic with more frequent messages; higher confidence in detection can be achieved at the cost of lower latency by waiting for multiple missing messages. 
Alternatives: Ping/echo tactic where the monitoring component requests responses.

</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">### Machine learning pattern for reproducibility: Feature Store

![Feature store pattern](feature-store.png)<!-- .element: style="width:600px" -->

Intent: Reuse features across projects by decoupling feature creation from model development and serving

<aside class="notes"><p>Source: <a href="https://changyaochen.github.io/ML-design-pattern-1/">https://changyaochen.github.io/ML-design-pattern-1/</a>
Motivation: The same feature engineering code is needed during model training and model serving; inconsistencies are dangerous. In addition, some features may be expensive to compute but useful in multiple projects. Also, data scientists often need the same or similar features across multiple projects, but often lack a systematic mechanism for reuse.
Solution: Separate feature engineering code and reuse it both in the training pipeline and the model inference infrastructure. Catalog features with metadata to make them discoverable. Cache computed features used in multiple projects. Typically implemented in open-source infrastructure projects.
Benefits: Reusable features across projects; avoiding redundant feature computations; preventing training-serving skew; central versioning of features; separation of concerns.
Costs: Nontrivial infrastructure; extra engineering overhead in data science projects.
This concept is discussed in more depth in chapter Deploying a Model.</p>

Constraints define the space of attributes for valid design solutions

</aside></script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Types of Constraints

**Problem constraints**: Minimum required QAs for an acceptable product

**Project constraint**s: Deadline, project budget, available personnel/skills

**Design constraints**
* Type of ML task required (regression/classification)
* Available data
* Limits on computing resources, max. inference cost/time

If there are multiple ML algorithms that satisfy the given constraints, which
one do we select?

Different ML qualities may conflict with each other; this requires
making a __trade-off__ between these qualities

Among the qualities of interest, which one(s) do we care the most
about?
* And which ML algorithm is most suitable for achieving those qualities?
* (Similar to requirements conflicts)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Multi-Objective Optimization

<!-- colstart -->

* Determine optimal solutions given multiple, possibly
  **conflicting** objectives
* **Dominated** solution: A solution that is inferior to
  others in every way 
* **Pareto frontier**: A set of non-dominated solutions
* Consider trade-offs among Pareto optimal solutions

<aside class="notes"><p>Tradeoffs among multiple design solutions along two dimensions (cost and error). Gray solutions are all dominated by others that are better both in terms of cost and error (e.g., solution D has worse error and worse cost than solution A). The remaining black solutions are each better than another solution on one dimension but worse on another — they are all pareto optimal and which solution to pick depends on the relative importance of the dimensions.</p>
