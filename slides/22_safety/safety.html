</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## The AI Alignment Problem

AI is optimized for a specific objective/cost function
  * Inadvertently cause undesirable effects on the environment
  * e.g., [Transport robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzlsvFN_5HI): Move a box to a specific destination
  * Side effects: Scratch furniture, bump into humans, etc.,

Side effects may cause ethical/safety issues (e.g., social media optimizing for clicks, causing teen depression)

Difficult to define sensible fitness functions:
  * Perform X *subject to common-sense constr. on the
    environment*
  * Perform X *but avoid side effects to the extent
      possible*

> PlayFun algorithm pauses the game of Tetris indefinitely to avoid losing  

> When about to lose a hockey game, the PlayFun algorithm exploits a bug to make one of the players on the opposing team disappear from the map, thus forcing a draw.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Reward Hacking

* AI can be good at finding loopholes to achieve a goal in unintended ways
* Technically correct, but does not follow *designer's informal intent*
* Many possible causes, incl. partially observed goals, abstract rewards, feedback loops
* In general, a very challenging problem!
  * Difficult to specify goal & reward function to avoid all
  possible hacks
  * Requires careful engineering and iterative reward design

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## AI Alignment Problem = Requirements Problem

Recall: "World vs. machine"
* Identify stakeholders in the environment & possible effects on them
* Anticipate side effects, feedback loops
* Constrain the scope of the system
* Perfect contracts usually infeasible, undesirable

But more requirements engineering unlikely to be only solution

deployment of AI systems today,” they wrote, citing worker
exploitation, data theft, synthetic media that props up existing power
structures and the further concentration of those power structures in
fewer hands.

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Defining Safety

Prevention of a system failure or malfunction that results in:
  * Death or serious injury to people
  * Loss or severe damage to equipment/property
  * Harm to the environment or society

Safety is a system concept
  * Can't talk about software/ML being "safe"/"unsafe" on its own
  * Safety is defined in terms of its effect on the **environment**
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Safety != Reliability

Reliability = absence of defects, mean time between failure

Safety = prevents accidents, harms

Can build safe systems from unreliable components (e.g. redundancy, safeguards)

System may be unsafe despite reliable components (e.g. stronger gas tank causes more severe damage in incident)

Accuracy is usually about reliability!

<!-- col -->

National Traffic & Motor Safety Act (1966):

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Safety Engineering

Safety Engineering: An engineering discipline which assures that engineered systems provide acceptable levels of safety.

Typical safety engineering process:
  * Identify relevant hazards & safety requirements
  * Identify potential root causes for hazards
  * For each hazard, develop a mitigation strategy
  * Provide evidence that mitigations are properly implemented


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Improving Safety of ML-Enabled Systems

Anticipate problems (hazard analysis, FTA, FMEA, HAZOP, ...)

Anticipate the existence of unanticipated problems

Plan for mistakes, design mitigations (recall earlier lecture!)
* Human in the loop
* Undoable actions, failsoft
* Guardrails
* Mistaked detection
* Redundancy, ...

</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template"># Demonstrating and Documenting Safety

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Demonstrating Safety

Two main strategies:

1. **Evidence of safe behavior in the field** 
   * Extensive field trials
   * Usually expensive
2. **Evidence of responsible (safety) engineering process**
   * Process with hazard analysis, testing mitigations, etc
   * Not sufficient to assure safety

Most standards require both

<div class="smallish">

* Guidelines & recommendations for achieving an acceptable level of
safety
* Examples: DO-178C (airborne systems), ISO  26262 (automotive), IEC 62304 (medical
software), Common Criteria (security)
* Typically, **prescriptive & process-oriented**
  * Recommends use of certain development processes
  * Requirements specification, design, hazard analysis, testing,
    verification, configuration management, etc., 
* Limitations
	* Most not designed to handle ML systems (exception: UL 4600)
	* Costly to satisfy & certify, but effectiveness unclear (e.g., many
    FDA-certified products recalled due to safety incidents)
* Good processes are important, but not sufficient; provides only indirect evidence for system safety

* An emerging approach to demonstrating safety
* An explicit argument that a system achieves a desired safety
requirement, along with supporting evidence
* Structure:

  * Evidence: Testing, software analysis, formal verification,
  inspection, expert opinions, design mechanisms...

![](movie-recommendation.png)
<!-- .element: class="stretch" -->

How would you argue that your recommendation system
provides at least 95% availability? What evidence would you provide? 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Assurance Cases: Benefits & Limitations

<div class="smallish">

* Provides an explicit structure to the safety argument
  * Easier to navigate, inspect, and refute for third-party auditors
  * Provides traceability between system-level claims &
    low-level evidence
  * Can also be used for other types of system quality (security,
    reliability, etc.,)
* Challenges and pitfalls
  * Informal links between claims & evidence, e.g., Does the sub-claims actually imply the top-level claim? 
  * Effort in constructing the case & evidence: How much evidence is enough?
  * System evolution: If system changes, must reproduce the case & evidence
* Tools for building & analyzing safety cases available
	* e.g., [ASCE/GSN](https://www.adelard.com/gsn.html) from Adelard
	* But ultimately, can't replace domain knowledge & critical thinking

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Other Challenges

<div class="smallish">

* Safe Exploration
  - Exploratory actions "in production" may have consequences
  - e.g., trap robots, crash drones
* Robustness to Drift
    - Drift may lead to poor performance that may not even be recognized
* Scalable Oversight
    - Cannot provide human oversight over every action (or label all possible training data)
  - Use indirect proxies in telemetry to assess success/satisfaction

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Robustness

Environment sometimes __deviates__ from expected, normal conditions
- Extreme weathers, unexpected obstacles, etc., 
- Erratic user behaviors; unusually high service demand
- Adversarial actors; users trying to game your system, etc., 

Does your system work reasonably well under these deviations? i.e., is
it _robust_?

Most safety-critical systems require some level of robustness
- Not enough to show that system is safe in normal conditions
